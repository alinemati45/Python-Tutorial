    "**OVERALL APPROACHES:** \n",
    "\n",
    "* Dealing with unbalanced data: Use resampling strategies            \n",
    "* Create new features : Principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce dimensionality, Autoencoders to create a latent space and possibly Clustering to create new features\n",

    "* (b) Classification - Given a patient with a tumor, we have to predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign.\n",
    "\n",
